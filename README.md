### I'm too cheap for a .io

This is be my "professional" website. Lists my experience, projects, etc etc. Stuff a company would use to decide to hire me...or not...

### How It's Made

I used what I learned in my Node.js and React Udemy courses, mostly React (there is really no back end to speak of). The design was created in Powerpoint, my mockup tool of choice (it works better that you'd expect). All icons were created by me using Google Drawings. Imagine what I could do with a real image editor! JQuery is used throughout but not exclusively. The CSS uses both flexbox and grid models and is written in SCSS. This site is simple but intended to prove I have some competency in web development.

Projects section to come...when I create a project besides this site.
